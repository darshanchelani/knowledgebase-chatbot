4AM in Karachi Lyrics

[Intro: Talha Anjum & Brooklyn Nicole]
Can't keep you close
I don't know where's—
What in the world do you—?
You, follow me, somewhere on the sea
Honestly
Every time, I've been thinking of our life
Every time, what you give is some of mine
All the time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Bagh ko tu shaakh mat dikha
Chotay mujhay aankh mat dikha
Tu roshni mat daal meri zaat pe
Tu sooraj ko chiragh mat dikha
Hisaab kar chuka apne amaal ka
Behad gunahgar behad khatakaar
Behas bekar, I’m the king of this shit
Kuch bhi scripted nai hai phir bhi lagay film ye
Kitnay laa-ilm hain wo meri vision se
Wo tou hansa kartay thay mere zikar pe
Big dawg spending two hundred liqour pe
Larkay baatein karein saari that I’m bigger than
Unke azam unke chehro pe dikh rahay
Par inki pohonch na mein boy tera waise bhi
They said they’re married to the game but ye casanova complex
Jahan wo chahtay numbers, it’s not about the legacy
I’m that same kid
Paise joray for recordings cuz I meant it
Ghar mein studio banaya, I don’t rent it
Going in and out the city and it’s hectic
Anti ab bhi kartay shakk kitnay skeptic
Tere fans ko kya yaad teri setlist?
Rockstar lifestyle and I’m reckless
Twenty minutes in your party and I brexit
Dekh mentality
I was 13 with a headphone hand held mic aur betahasha audacity
Now they keep asking me, "mein kaisa karu feel?"
Chotay I’m good
Abhi idher hain tou idher ke hum baap loug
And when I’m gone tou kahaniya sunayein ge tumhein jo wo chalay thay mere saath loug
Tujhay yaaro mein kya bhai milay?
Bhai milay jinke dilo mein safai milay?
Na he milein tujhay saanp tere raastay mein
Tujhay jab bhi milay bhai bas dua he milay
Lougo se hota nai ab album ka wait aur
But as an artist meri apni mental state aur
36 beatein 36 baatein peeth peechay
Feature enj maangan o mein jivein vadda J. Cole

[Outro]
I just sit back and think kitnay mujhse khaar khayein ge?
Came from nothing rab ki naemat behisaab bhai pe
I got everything I need mujhay kya chahiye?
Dil ki gali mein baraye karam na ayie
I just sit back and think kitnay mujhse khaar khayein ge?
Came from nothing rab ki naemat behisaab bhai pe
I got everything I need mujhay kya chahiye?
Dil ki gali mein baraye karam na ayie
